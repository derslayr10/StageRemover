# StageRemover
A simple mod that removes stages from the destination pool in RoR2. Currently only works for Sundered Grove.

## How it works
Stage Remover interrupts the normal process of the game deciding which stage you should go to next, and instead forces it to pick a new destination if what it originally chose is within the list of "disabled" stages. By using the config file generated by the mod, you are able to control which stages are enabled and disabled, even (hopefully) modded maps. This should make the mod relatively lightweight and hopefully not interfere too heavily with other mods that allow you to add or remove maps, though conflicts are still expected.

## Changelog

- v1.0.0
	- Initial version of the mod. Currently only works on Sundered Grove by completely removing it from the game's destination pool at the start of a run.
 - v2.0.0
	 - Total rewrite of algorithm.
	 - Now has config options to control which maps are enabled and disabled.
	 - No longer removes map from destination pool to avoid conflicts. Mod now simply forces the game to choose a new location if the initially chosen destination is disabled in config.
	 - Hopefully supports modded maps, though you will need to know the SceneName for the map to use this feature.

## Future Plans

 - Implement method to change starting stage (low priority)
 - Improve handling of modded maps (only priority if current methods are not functional)
 - Larger scale testing
